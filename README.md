## <span id="description">Description</span>

This repository brings together technical resources written in French to support Holberton School students in their learning journey. While all official documentation and projects at Holberton are in English, which is a deliberate and valuable choice, given the importance of English in the software industry, we also welcome students from all backgrounds, with no prior experience or prerequisites. For some of them, especially at the beginning, the language barrier can slow down their understanding of technical concepts.

As an educational manager and software engineer at Holberton School, I created this space to provide additional guidance and clarity in French. These materials are not intended to replace the English resources, but rather to serve as a stepping stone for students who may need an extra push to fully grasp the fundamentals.

Writing these guides also gives me the opportunity to reinforce my own technical knowledge, reflect on the core concepts we teach, and improve my technical writing, a skill thatâ€™s just as essential as coding when it comes to sharing knowledge, documenting work, or writing articles as a developer.

This initiative is above all a way to make technical education more accessible, while staying aligned with Holberton's values: inclusion, autonomy, and excellence.
